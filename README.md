### Description
This is an open source repository that supplies diffusion-MRI data with tensor-valued diffusion encoding. Data is available in a healthy human brain in vivo as well as water, oil and liquid crystal phantoms. The repository also contains detailed information and resources concerning the experiment and its design.

**Value of the data:**  
* The data facilities design and testing of analysis techniques that require tensor-valued (or multidimensional) diffusion encoding. This provides value since acquisition of such data currently relies on a custom pulse sequence that is not widely available.
* The data includes repeated sampling of spherical b-tensors for analysis of noise characteristics.
* A subset of the data is matched with respect to the diffusion time spectrum for analysis of models of diffusion time dependency.
