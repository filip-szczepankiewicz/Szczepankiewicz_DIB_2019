### Description
This is an open source repository that supplies diffusion-MRI data with tensor-valued diffusion encoding. Data is available in a healthy human brain in vivo as well as water, oil and liquid crystal phantoms. The repository also contains detailed information and resources concerning the experiment and its design.
